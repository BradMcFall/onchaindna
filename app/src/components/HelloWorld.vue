    <p>The onset of mass DNA sequencing and the sale of large quantities of personalized genomic information to pharmaceutical companies led to a global emergence of DNA blockchain companies attempting to manage the transfer of an individual’s DNA sequence for research and development without removing the control of private DNA data from the owner. DNATIX patented a compression algorithm and was the first to demonstrate transfer of an entire human genome over the blockchain.  Some have decided to store the DNA information off chain.  Nebula Genomics seeks to create a large store of data and proprietary systems through which it can be accessed.  The general plan is simply to have the owners rights protected while having the each individuals entire dna sequence available for transfer.   This emergence of the DNA blockchain economy is tending towards a centralization of effort as they each compete for individual users although these is some general geographic differentiation appearing. At the present rate of adoption it will be at least 5 years before this nascent economic sector is mature enough to fulfill it’s promise of transferring sufficient amounts of data to be useful for pratical development.  Coupled with this delay caused by competition is an on-going concern that promises of personalized and precision medicine which underwrote the original transfers of large quantities of private DNA data to big pharma may have been oversold.  Given this background it is entirely reasonable to imagine that DNA blockchains and their associated cryptocurrencies are going to go the way of so many of the altcoins as is the general consensus of expert prognosticators.
     </p>
    <p>A new blockchain platform called Avalanche has integrated infrastructure that permits small amounts of arbitrary data to accompany any transaction of a non-fungible token.  I propose to solve the concerns of the DNA blockchain marketplace by attaching small amounts of medically indicated disease mutation data on Avalanche NFts and enable the transfer of these small amounts to be specically sold for the purpose of pursuing precision medicine by the search for correlated mutations amongst large numbers of  sold nfts specific for a particular disease. BY creating a DNA NFT marketplace on avalahcne with millions of users one can propel not the mass marketing of dna sequences but the specific research dand development needs.  As more and more people join then larger portions may become made available but this will enable the a small cottege industry to develop as the tech is perfected and things such as privacy and security get worked in.</p>
    <p>The seller thus is any one with a Genome sequence that will be analyzed for mutations to known diseases,  100kb of data around those mutations will be removed and attached as payloads to Avalanche NFTS of varying overlaps from the mutation position,  these overlaps regions- greyed out-   from all of the users will be displayed in a marketplace from which , this marketplace multiple alignement will enable a buyer to who is searching for data on correlated mutations can select those they wish to work with and purchase.</p>
    <p>Precision medicine is the ability to target specific treatments and therapeutics to an individual based on their genomic senquence information.  Because of the relation of structure and function in adapted proteins the evolution of amino acid sequences is constrained and this constraint appears to force additional mutations to appear after an  initial mutation has occurred where in three dimensions the two mutations would come in contact.  If there are correlated mutatins that are stati;stoically associated with a particular disease then one way to begin the design of drugs targeted to that di;sease is to find molecular interactions associated with this correlated disease mutational pairs within the constraint of it’s altered normality.  The buyer of the Avalanche DNA NFts will have the primary data from which to predict the three dimensionality of diseased proteins from which it’s altered function in that structure can  commence.
Thus perhaps next year instead of 5 years from now – we will see results of precision medicine from the sale of consumer DNA information.
